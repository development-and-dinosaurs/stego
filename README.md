# Stego - State Transition Event Guard Orchestrator

Stego is a runtime for Kotlin Multiplatform that unites server-driven UI and formal state machines.

Using the concepts from Harel Statecharts and extended state machines, Stego allows consumers to write declarative user
journeys combining UI and logic flows in a simple way, and drive these flows from the server for super quick releases.

Use Stego to define behavior once and run it everywhere, ensuring that your client UIs always stay in sync with the
serverâ€™s intent while remaining safe, testable, and deterministic.
