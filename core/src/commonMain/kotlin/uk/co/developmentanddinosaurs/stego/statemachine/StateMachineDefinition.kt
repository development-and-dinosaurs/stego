 * It contains no runtime logic or state, only the blueprint for how the machine should be constructed.
 *
 * @property initial The ID of the top-level initial [State] that the machine will be in upon starting.
 * @property states A map of all top-level states in the state machine, keyed by their unique IDs.
 * @property initialContext The initial [Context] of the state machine.
