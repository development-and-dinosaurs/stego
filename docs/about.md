# About Stego

## The Motivation

Modern application development often involves managing complex, ever-changing state. As features grow, so does the potential for bugs, race conditions, and unpredictable behavior. How many times have you found your application in a state you thought was impossible?

Stego was born out of a need to bring order to this chaos. Inspired by the formalisms of Harel statecharts, we wanted to create a Kotlin-first framework that puts predictable state management at the very heart of the application architecture.

The goal was to build a system where developers could model complex business logic as a series of clear, testable states and transitions, effectively eliminating entire classes of bugs.

## The Philosophy: Structure and Predictability

The name **Stego** is an acronym for **S**tate **T**ransition **E**vent **G**uard **O**rchestrator. This isn't just a name; it's our core philosophy. We believe that by breaking down application logic into these fundamental components, we can build more robust, maintainable, and understandable software.

By enforcing that all state changes happen through explicit events and guarded transitions, Stego ensures that your application behaves exactly as you designed it to.

## Why "Stego"?

The name is a nod to the Stegosaurus, fitting the theme of our home at Development and Dinosaurs. Just as the Stegosaurus had plates for structure and defense, Stego provides a strong, structured backbone for your application's logic.
 
Plus, let's be honest: it's one of the few recognizable dinosaur names that actually works as an acronym. You try making one out of 'Pachycephalosaurus'. We'll wait.

## Open Source and Community

Stego is a fully open-source project. We believe in the power of community and welcome contributions of all kinds. Whether you're fixing a bug, proposing a new feature, or improving the documentation, we'd love to have you involved.
